My PhD supervisors are prof. Subramanian Ramamoorthy and prof. Timothy Hospedales. I have been very fortunate to collaborate with and learn from many others including Dr. F. Meier, Dr. M Burke, K. Luck, J, Scholz, Y. Aytar, and M. Wulfmeier. I also completed two Google X AI Residencies where I was hosted and supervised by prof. Stefan Schaal and where I was involved with project Intrinsic. I also completed a Research Scientist internship at DeepMind where I was hosted by Dr. Jon Scholz and Dr. Oleg Sushov.
