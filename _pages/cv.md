{% include base_path %}
Broadly, my interests lie in the intersection of robotics and machine learning.
In my PhD I focus on improving the sample efficiency and robustness of learnt models through utilising inductive biases in the context of robotics applications. In the past, I have studied ways of building such biases through learning modular and re-usable across tasks world models \[[1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9309332?source=authoralert), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06422)\]; demonstrations \[[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07682),[4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09034)\]; transfer learning \[[5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02675)\]; and extracted hierarchies \[[6](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5a1e977db94c9524c9fa0448)\]. I have particular interest in fast contact-rich skill acquisitions, such as peg, gear and plug insertions and have also studied ways to improve 2D trajectory generation in crowded and collaborative settings as well as extracting robust to perturbations and task representations.
With this, I am generally excited about projects combining ML/RL and robotics, including working on algorithms, simulations, and actual robot experimentation.
