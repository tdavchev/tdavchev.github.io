2016-09-01	Modelling Entailment with Neural Networks	MSc Thesis	This work is about modelling entailment with CNNs. We show that our approach achieves better results than the existing techniques and reducing the feature engineering requirements..	Davchev, Todor. (2016).

2019-05-07	An Empirical Evaluation of Adversarial Robustness under Transfer Learning.	ICML 2019, workshop	This paper studies the effects of using robust optimisation in the context of adversarial attacks. This allows us to identify transfer learning strategies under which adversarial defences are successfully retained, in addition to revealing potential vulnerabilities.

2019-12-12	Vid2Param: Modelling of Dynamics Parameters from Video.	IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters	This work shows how models trained entirely in simulation, in an end-to-end manner can perform online system identification, and make probabilistic forward predictions of parameters of interest in the phyical world.	Asenov, M., Burke, M., Angelov, D., Davchev, T., Subr, K. and Ramamoorthy, S., 2019. Vid2Param: Modeling of Dynamics Parameters From Video. <i>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</i>, 5(2), pp.414-421.	paper-title-number-4	http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ksubr/Files/Papers/ICRA20Vid2Param.pdf
2020-08-18	Residual Learning from Demonstration.	arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.07682	In this work we propose residual learning from demonstration (rLfD), a framework that combines dynamic movement primitives (DMP) that rely on behavioural cloning with a reinforcement learning (RL) based residual correction policy.
