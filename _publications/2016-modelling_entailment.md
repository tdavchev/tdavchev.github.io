excerpt: 'Sentence classification is currently among the unresolved challenges of Natural Language Understanding and Machine Learning. In this thesis we focus on modelling entailment relations which can be considered as a sub-problem of sentence classification.
We show that the results from the currently adopted Recurrent Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory models can be matched and even outperformed for recognising textual entailment. More specifically, we show that other techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), tackle the problem in a similar in terms of accuracy, however simpler in terms of feature engineering approach. We propose a novel Siamese-like 3-CNN-wide architecture. We extend that model by applying a variety of mathematical operations to the intermediate input of the third
CNN. More precisely, we exploit the low dimensionality representation of the already processed initial inputs via a series of linear and multiplicative operands. We then show that our approach achieves better results than the existing techniques, however significantly increasing the size of the parameters trained. Nevertheless, our implementation has a modular and loosely coupled architecture.'

This work is about modelling entailment with CNNs. We show that our approach achieves better results than the existing techniques and reducing the feature engineering requirements.
