permalink: /publication/2020-residual-lfd
excerpt: 'Contacts and friction are inherent to nearly all robotic manipulation tasks. Through the motor skill of insertion, we study how robots can learn to cope when these attributes play a salient role. In this work we propose residual learning from demonstration (rLfD), a framework that combines dynamic movement primitives (DMP) that rely on behavioural cloning with a reinforcement learning (RL) based residual correction policy. The proposed solution is applied directly in task space and operates on the full pose of the robot. We show that rLfD outperforms alternatives and improves the generalisation abilities of DMPs. We evaluate this approach by training an agent to successfully perform both simulated and real world insertions of pegs, gears and plugs into respective sockets.'
