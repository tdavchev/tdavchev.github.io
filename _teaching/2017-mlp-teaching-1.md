I was heavily involved with the MLP course. My role involved helping and assisting with the course content, demonstrating, tutoring and marking.

Demonstrating
======
I acted as a Demonstrator 2 years in a row. My roles involved helping students understand and implement core concepts from the Deep Learning literature as well as helping them with grasp the course material.

Tutor
======
I supervised 10 groups of MSc students who conduct publishable research on various topics in Deep Learning. My role in supervising consisted in helping students choose and formulate relevant machine learning research questions on their own, conduct experimental evaluation and writing papers. Best results were submitted to a top tier conference workshop and namely workshop on Understanding and Improving Generalization at ICML 2019 - [Download paper here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07682.pdf)

Marker
======
My role as a marker was to make sure I provide constructive feedback to all students works and grade their performance.
